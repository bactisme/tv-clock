tv-clock
========

I made this project to learn node.js and angular at the end
It is a timer/stopwatch synchronized between tabs/devices.

The goal is to use it during our tv-show recording : my parts sould last 10minutes, nothing more.

0. Install *node* and *npn*
1. Install dependancies with *npn install*
2. Launch server via node server.js or install as daemon via supervisorctl for example
